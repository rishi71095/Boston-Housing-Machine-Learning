# Boston-Housing-Machine-Learning


In this project, we delve into the realm of linear regression and regularization techniques using Lasso and Ridge Regression in Python. Linear regression serves as the foundation, offering a straightforward model to predict outcomes based on input features. However, as we venture deeper, we encounter the common pitfalls of overfitting and underfitting. To combat these challenges, we introduce regularization methods, shedding light on their significance.

Our journey begins with an exploration of Lasso Regression, short for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. We illustrate how Lasso Regression employs a penalty factor (alpha) to shrink coefficients, effectively reducing model complexity and addressing multicollinearity. Notably, Lasso Regression's unique geometric constraints allow it to perform automatic feature selection by shrinking coefficients towards zero, rendering less important features inconsequential.

We don't stop there. We also introduce Ridge Regression, which shares a similar objective but takes a different route by considering the square of coefficients (L2 Regularization). Practical implementation is a core component of our project, where we employ Python to load and preprocess the Boston housing dataset. We analyze multicollinearity, prepare the data, and proceed to build, compare, and evaluate Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression models.

Additionally, we investigate the importance of alpha values, using cross-validation techniques to select optimal values for Lasso Regression. Our journey culminates in a comprehensive comparison of coefficients across these models and vivid visualizations that illustrate the impact of regularization on feature selection. Through this project, we gain a deeper understanding of these regression techniques and their practical applications in real-world data analysis.
